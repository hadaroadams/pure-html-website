    <h2>Descriptions on Banku</h2>
    <p>
        Banku is a traditional Ghanaian dish that is made 
        from fermented corn and cassava dough. It is a popular 
        staple food in Ghana and is often served with a variety 
        of soups, stews, and sauces.
        To make banku, corn and cassava dough are mixed with water 
        and left to ferment for several days. The mixture is then 
        cooked on the stove, stirring constantly until it becomes 
        thick and smooth. The resulting dough is then shaped into balls and served hot.
        Banku has a slightly sour taste due to the fermentation 
        process and has a soft, doughy texture. It is often eaten 
        with soup or stew made from fish, meat, or vegetables. Banku 
        is also sometimes served with okra soup or groundnut soup, 
        which are both popular in Ghanaian cuisine.
        Banku is a nutritious and filling meal that is rich in carbohydrates 
        and fiber. It is a staple food in Ghanaian households and is enjoyed 
        by people of all ages. If you're looking to experience traditional 
        Ghanaian cuisine, banku is definitely a dish to try.
